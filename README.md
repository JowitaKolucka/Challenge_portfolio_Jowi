#### Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
Hi! I am Jowita and I chose this course because I participated in a manual testing challenge which I enjoyed. 
The challenge taught me many useful and interesting skills. 
I want to learn good code-writing practices and I like challenges.
